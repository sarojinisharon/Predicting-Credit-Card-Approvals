# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
In this project built a machine learning model to predict credit card approval using a dataset. It involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and applying logistic regression. The model is optimized with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to improve performance.
